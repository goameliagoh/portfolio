            <div class="about-content">
                <p>I’m Amelia Goh, a student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a strong drive for innovation and problem-solving. I am currently pursuing a diploma in Information Technology (IT) with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a passionate student in the IT field, I’ve had the opportunity to dive into exciting projects that span from web developments to AI chatbots, and more.</p>
                <p>Throughout my studies, I have tackled diverse challenges, from developing sophisticated front-end and back-end solutions for complex websites to exploring the transformative potential of AI in real-world applications. My experiences have also honed my abilities as both a team member and a leader, especially through collaborative projects and Agile methodologies like Scrum, which further enhanced my project management skills.</p>
                <p> I’m always eager to take on new challenges and learn from each experience. As you scroll further down my portfolio, you would see the highlights of some of my favorite projects, and I invite you to explore them. If you’re interested in collaborating or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! My contact details are presented below.</p>

                <h3>Ever Lovely Jewel Website</h3>
                <p>I created my first website for a fictional jewelry store called Ever Lovely Jewel, focusing entirely on front-end development. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The images above features the product page displaying necklaces followed by the product details with the footer. Lastly, it shows the contact page. No back-end development involved in this project as the primary goal of this project was to showcase front-end skills.</p>

                <h3>AmeliaXWeiying Website</h3>
                <p>AmeliaXWeiying is the second website I developed in collaboration with my teammate, Weiying, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The fourth image showcases our product offerings, while the fifth image features the add-to-cart functionality. The sixth and seventh images introduces and details our Whack-a-Mole game, respectively. The eighth and ninth images are dedicated to our Trivia Quiz game. The last image showcases our footer design. In this project, our user management including registration, login, and points tracking are managed through Restdb.io.

                <h3>EduHelper Website</h3>
                <p>EduHelper is an educational website I developed with three teammates, utilizing Node.js, Express, and an SQL database with the MVC architecture. I took charge of the comments and reviews features, where I implemented CRUD and also input validation using JOI and user authorization with Json Web Token (JWT). This setup allows only logged-in users to create comments and reviews, and ensures that only the original poster can edit or delete their submissions. The first image shows the index page users see when they first visit the site. The second image displays how reviews would be displayed for each lecturer videos. Currently, the user logged in is "John Doe." The next two images highlights the pop-ups for creating and editing reviews, designed using Gignite.AI. The fifth image then showcases how the comment section would look like for each discussions. In this image, you can also see how I integrated Google Cloud's translation API to translate non-English comments to English and also display the detected language. The next two images shows the pop-ups for creating and editing comments, also designed with Gignite.AI. Finally, the last image presents the user dashboard, where users can view, edit, or delete their reviews and see the total number of reviews they have posted.</p>

                <h3>Ngee Ann City Game</h3>
                <p>Ngee Ann City is a strategic building game where players construct and manage various types of buildings such as commercial and industrial buildings to earn points, scores, and also coins. This game features two modes: Arcade Mode and Free Play Mode, each with its own unique scoring system. This game project was successfully created by our team of 5, which consisted of three developers, including myself, alongside a dedicated Scrum Master and Product Owner, both of whom also contributed as developers. Our lecturer acted as the stakeholder for this project. Our team made use of HTML, CSS, JS for this project and adopted the SCRUM framework to manage the project, completing it over four two-week sprints. We utilized JIRA for tracking our sprints, conducted daily scrums and sprint reviews via Microsoft Teams, and performed sprint retrospectives using Retrotool.io. The first five images illustrate our game’s design, showcasing the different game modes, saved games, and also the high score lists. Following that, the next few images gives you an insight into our development process, showcasing our sprint issues, retrospectives, and burndown charts for each of the four sprints.</p>
